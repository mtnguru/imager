Initially the canvas size is set by the screen size and image size as I do now.
Once the viewer is up, the canvas remains at it's current size.
Changing the image changes the viewport?
Have an option to fit browser and an option for full screen.

Once the viewer is displayed it can be resized.
If resized the final dimensions are exactly what they are set to be.
Make the canvas-wrapper 100% width and height.
When resized the wrapper changes size.:w






At this point the viewer isn't loaded.  I used to create this in a div:w




Right now I'm working on making Imager a field formatter.  
I really only want one canvas - I can move it around from image to image?
Initially have the formatter display the image using the view-mode.
Or do I always have this load the full image - no.
Load the full image when the user chooses to see it.
Otherwise use the current view-mode - select that where?
  Through a data statement - like I'm doing with class and data on the atomizer?
  It works, requires users to know the names of the classes.
  I could put available classes in the description.  That'll do it.
Let's go back to the original imager.
The formatter displays the image using the view-mode selected on set-up.
This can also be selected in the WYSIWYG.


Have the JavaScript create the canvas for the editor/popup.  It doesn't have to be done by php.  Basically have a once function there.
Attach the libraries

Imager builds a list of items based on context - What happens if images don't worry about it for now.

First time imager runs
  Add the popups and canvas to the page through JavaScript

Next time - search for additional images and add to the list.
