I'm nearing completion of a JavaScript Colorbox like module that let's you view, zoom, pan, crop, change brightness/contrast and hue/saturation/lightness of an image interactively.  It can be viewed here -- http://eugeology.rocks/media-gallery.  Click on an image to popup the image viewer/editor.  All the image editing works -- I need help storing the new image.  Can someone familiar with the media_entity module give me some help?
